							<h2>Penetration Testing</h2>
							<p>The attack surface of your company is more exposed than you might think. You have external facing applications that has a mutual trust relation with applications inside your organisation. Vulnerabilities may exist in these areas, on both application but also at infrastructural level. How do you know your network and applications are resilient against modern attacks? With our penetration testing service, we can identify vulnerabilities that could impact your services or your business. Contrahack has created a unique methodology for the application and infrastructural areas to make sure all the vulnerabilities are discovered so you have one less thing to worry about. </p>

Our Experienced security experts use scenarios comparable to the attack scenarios that a real attacker would also use. For example setting up email phishing campaigns, dropping USB hardware devices or retrieving information such as trying to retrieve sensitive information from your employees. </p>

							<h2>Secure Software Development</h2>
							<p>The application landscape has drastically changed in the past years. We moved from a waterfall way of working to the new agile way. Now that applications are being developed in this DevOps way and releases happen every day how do we make sure we are still in control of security? How can you and your company include the security in DevOps and become truly SecDevOps and in control? Long lasting security knowledge, skills and being in control - are the expected outcomes of this secure software development service. Using our proven methodology will enable and empower your developers to build secure applications by design.  </p>

							<h2>Secure code audit</h2>
							<p>We have an unique way of performing a secure code audit that really has a lot of added value for your development team. The way we perform a secure code audit is by using the security controls from the OWASP-ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard). This standard that is being used by Military, Banks, Healthcare and governments all over the world.</p>
							<p>How we conduct the secure code review is together with the development team having the source code of the application on a beamer. We work closely together with your developers to verify if all the security controls are implemented and also if they are implemented in a secure manner. Having this approach of conducting a secure coding audit it allows to improve the security knowledge of all the developers participating in this exercise. Also this approach is way faster then the traditional secure code audits because our approach will take only around 2 days to perform and after the audit you will be receiving a certificate that the application applied the level 1-3 security controls. Our goal is to empower and teach the developers how the write new projects and secure by design by introducing the OWASP-SKF (Security Knowledge Framework) and it’s completely free to use as it’s an open-source project. With this you have actionable knowledge inside your company to build applications secure by design.</p>

							<h2>OWASP-SKF as a Service</h2>
							<p>Over 20 years of experience in web application security bundled into a single application. The Security Knowledge Framework is a vital asset to the coding toolkit of you and your development team. Use SKF to learn and integrate security by design in your web application by training your developers in writing secure code. The SKF is an open-source application that can be used for free by everyone but do you need help to have it installed on-premise or setup in a cloud? Then you can contact us and we will assist you and do this for you, also when there needs to be modifications done we can do this for you so you have one thing less to worry about.</p>
